# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game, created as part of a learning exercise while watching a video by Anjana Vakil on Frontend Masters. The HTML and CSS for the grid, headings, and player names were provided in the video but were further customized.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player game: Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
- Players take turns to mark the grid.
- The game checks for a win or a draw after each move.
- A reset button to start a new game.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.
3. The game starts with Player 1 ('X').
4. Players take turns clicking on the squares to place their mark.
5. The game will display a message when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
